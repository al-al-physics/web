<h5>First and silly rhythms with the TE PO-12</h5></a>

The Teenage Engineering PO-12 Rhythm Pocket Calculator is an amazing toy to experiment with rhythms. It is not a super professional
drum machine, but more than enough for an amateur like me who just wants to learn. And for a pianist, it can be seen as well as an
enhanced metronome. Are you bored of practising with an old metronome? Try the po-12 to have more fun. You can modulate the amount
of swing, so it is ideal even for jazz!<br><br>

I will share here three very silly examples that I have created just to practice with the basics. And since only 16 patterns can be
stored, this blog can be a good opportunity to store them in a permanent way by using an image file. For example, let's begin with
a very simple one:<br><br>
