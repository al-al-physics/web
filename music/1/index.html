<h5>Menuet BWV 113 from the Album of Anna Magdalena Bach (Anonymous composer)</h5></a>

I have chosen the Album of Anna Magdalena Bach as my first recording material. With it, I want to learn how to record and edit tracks, and to experiment with different
sounds. For now, all piano tracks come from the Royal Grand of the Nord Stage 3. I will postpone recording on my real grand piano until I learn more about how to properly set the microphones in the room. <br><br>

This is also a good exercise of studying a simple piece, recording it and letting it go. Otherwise, I feel the (obsessive) pressure of keeping it as part of my study and this prevents me from expanding my repertoire. Recording each piece is a nice way to remember that I could play them.  <br><br>
